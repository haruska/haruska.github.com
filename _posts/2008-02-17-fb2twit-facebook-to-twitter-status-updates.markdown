title: "fb2twit: facebook to twitter status updates"
---
I wrote a Facebook application called [fb2twit](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=21387115531) to send [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) status updates to [Twitter](http://twitter.com). The official twitter app and others only seem to go the other way (Twitter to Facebook). However, I find people who update their statuses on Facebook all the time mildly annoying. However, that is expected on Twitter. With this app you can update Facebook a couple of times a day while updating Twitter to your heart's content. 

So if you use both Facebook and Twitter, [install fb2twit](http://apps.facebook.com/fbtotwit/) and [let me know what you think](http://www.facebook.com/board.php?uid=21387115531)!
