title: ASC podcast script for linux
---
I updated the <a href="http://haruska.com/documents/a-better-all-songs-considered-podcast/">ASC podcast page with a similar script for linux</a>. It only requires mplayer and lame. If you use Ubuntu, be sure to <a href="http://haruska.com/ubuntu-mplayer-not-detecting-end-of-stream-8">read my previous post</a> and compile it from source.
