This little experiment started with me having a software problem, as most good projects do. There isn't a good way to have Facebook status updates get copied to twitter but not the other way around.

I've found out that open source software works, however open source **services** do not. I cannot believe the number of people demanding I fix or improve things on the project.

Also, it was costing me real money. I had to host a server to ping Facebook for status updates of the 500+ users and update twitter every 5 minutes. It's only $120 / year but I couldn't get anyone to step up and sponsor it (Twitter, hello?)

But I think the biggest factor is I don't really update my status on Facebook anymore. I use twitter daily, but that's because I have a core group of people there that expect me to "bother" them with the little ideas that pop into my head 120 characters at a time.

So, in the end I was maintaining a code base and a web service that I wasn't even a customer for anymore. Time to shut it down.

Of course, [the code to fb2twit is up on github](http://github.com/haruska/fb2twit/tree/master) (it always has been.) All any of the lechers have to do is pay to host it and put it up there.
