title: multiple songs in iPhoto slideshow
---
Just a quick tip. This was driving me crazy and it doesn't seem to be answered anywhere on the web. Even worse, there is some mis-information saying you need to use iMovie, etc.

To have multiple songs in a slideshow in iPhoto, just select an iTunes **playlist** instead of an individual song. You may have to create a new custom playlist in iTunes, but it works flawlessly without resorting to a lot of importing and exporting.
