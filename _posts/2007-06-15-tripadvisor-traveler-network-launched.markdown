title: TripAdvisor traveler network launched
---
Very exciting times here at TripAdvisor. I told you in a previous post how my google mashup launched early for the facebook app. Well, that was actually part of a larger push by TripAdvisor to move into the social network space. It was a lot of hard work by some very dedicated people and it all launched at midnight last night.

It is a pretty cool premise where you build a network of fellow travelers. Once this network is created, any user reviews and other content that your network submitted will bubble to the top of the pages you're viewing when planning a trip. Now you don't have to rely on totally anonymous advice on hotel rooms when booking. We just crossed the 10 million mark for user generated content submitted to TripAdvisor, so it's nice to see if you have people that you actually know who has visited the same places. Wow, actual social networking with a purpose of sharing good information!

Be sure to fill out your TravelMap when you sign up!
