title: custom mactel kernel in ubuntu
---
Almost everything on the MacBook Pro works out of the box on Ubuntu. However, there are some minor annoyances that are solved by the mactel patches and the 2.6.18 kernel. I've put up some instructions on [how to compile your own kernel for Ubuntu](/2007/03/31/compiling-2-6-18-kernel-for-ubuntu-on-a-macbook-pro), specifically geared towards the MBP.

For those of you uncomfortable with compiling your own kernels, [download my debian packages](http://svn.haruska.com/ubuntu/mactel/) and follow the instructions on how to install.
