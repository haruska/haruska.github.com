I'd like to pose a question to my 6+ readers out there:

> Do you set aside time from your hectic schedule for hacking personal projects?

I think it is important to write code for yourself in addition to your job. Problem is most of our schedules do not allow for tons of personal time and the free time you *do* get must be divided in to things like reading, recreation, hacking, etc. So hacking as a hobby as an adult needs to be more organized than in college.

Do people have tips for maximizing time spent coding? For me personally, I get lots of good ideas for software I'd like to see which makes it hard to stay focused on any one project. As a result I end up half completing them. The trick is to write those ideas down somewhere and pick them off the list one at a time. I'll probably start maintaining that list on this site to collect my thoughts.

The other idea is to really set aside time for personal coding. Sometimes I'll be solving problems at work all day that I continue to work on those same problems in to the evening. As a result, my personal projects suffer. I've made it a habit to try and set aside at least an hour a day for personal coding. It really isn't that hard to do if you actually schedule it like anything else.
