>And several intriguing Web-based iPhone apps from local developers were on display last night. One of the coolest that I saw was Snapmylife, an online photo sharing community for camera-phone users built by Needham, MA-based Mobicious. It’s basically Flickr for phones, and it’s drop-dead simple

MoMo Boston was interesting. I'm glad Apple let hackers get up and talk about "open" development for the iPhone. I wonder if these guys will release sanctioned apps when they're being sold on iTunes.
