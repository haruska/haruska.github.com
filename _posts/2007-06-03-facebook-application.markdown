There's been a lot of chatter about [Facebook](http://facebook.com) opening up [an API to third-party developers](http://developers.facebook.com).

I was part of a small team put together to [integrate the TravelMap as a Facebook app](http://apps.facebook.com/tripadvisortravelmap title:TravelMap Facebook app). It was a lot of hard work and long hours by a small team of dedicated developers but it's a pretty slick result. [Add it to your Facebook profile!](http://apps.facebook.com/tripadvisortravelmap)
