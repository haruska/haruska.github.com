title: Building a better All Songs Considered podcast
---
<a href="http://www.npr.org/" title="National Public Radio">National Public Radio</a>â€™s music program <em><a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/asc/" title="All Songs Considered">All Songs Considered</a> </em>is a great weekly program that features new (mostly) adult alternative music. NPR has started publishing a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rss/podcast/podcast_detail.php?siteId=4819413" title="ASC Podcast">podcast</a> of the show but it leaves a bit to be desired.

I've uploaded to the documents section a <a href="http://www.blogger.com/documents/a-better-all-songs-considered-podcast/" title="Better ASC podcast">script that creates a better ASC podcast</a>. It is OS X only at the moment because of an Apple tool it uses, but I'll be uploading a more useful Linux script soon.
