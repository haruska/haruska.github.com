title: Managing your online networks and content?
---
I was wondering how everyone keeps their content and social networks straight online. I have a profile on LinkedIn and am probably joining Flickr soon to share wedding and honeymoon photos. I originally set up Gallery, but uploading the pictures to Flickr makes the photos that much more valuable to friends and family. This is similar to having a LinkedIn profile vs. just posting your resume on your personal website.

I'm not the first to say this, but I think this is where it is going for the average user. Give up control of your personal online "presence" to other companies that do it well. I should probably get a FaceBook network together while we're at it to keep in touch with personal contacts to go along with my professional contacts at LinkedIn. When I get in to video, why not a YouTube profile to go with my Flickr profile? Why manage your own ramblings, when Blogger can do it for you?

Also, with Google's tools for your domain, why not just let Google handle your email, documents, and calendars? Moving off the desktop to the web could be liberating at the cost of losing control of your data. Does it matter?

Next, I need a site that is just an aggregate of all these other sites in one place. Maybe that's what haruska.com will become.
