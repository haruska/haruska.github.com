title: Consider Donating To Your Favorite Open Source Projects
---

It's that time of year again where people seem to be extra generous. Consider donating to small software projects that have made your life easier this year. Some of my favorites include:

* [redmine](http://www.redmine.org/)
* [rubber](http://github.com/wr0ngway/rubber)
* [rubinius](http://rubini.us/)
* [mms2r](http://github.com/monde/mms2r)
* [cucumber](http://cukes.info/)

Thanks to github, most now take credit card donations. Thanks for all the great software!
