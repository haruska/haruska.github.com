title: Desktop version of SML launched
---
Following yesterday's post about the iPhone version of the site, we also launched a [desktop browser version of SnapMyLife](http://www.snapmylife.com).

This was accomplished much the same way as the iPhone site. Rails 2 makes it a snap for additional formats to be added. 

We attempt to redirect you to the most optimal version of the site based on your user agent string, but you are free to choose which site you want. All three sites have a "change format" link.
